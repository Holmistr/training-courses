# Hazelcast Training

[Hazelcast IMDG](http://imdg.hazelcast.org)

[Hazelcast Jet](http://jet.hazelcast.org)

This is the new home for lab exercises that are used in Hazelcast training courses (whether delivered
on-line or on-site)

If you're not attending one of these sessions it's not going to be a great learning
resource. Instead you should go [here](https://training.hazelcast.com/) and sign-up
for the *free* online training.
