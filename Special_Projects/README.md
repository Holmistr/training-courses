#Cloud-Based IMDG Training

This is a brief (suitable for a lunch-and-learn type format) training course
focused on using IMDG as a database cache, and designed for multiple 
deployment scenarios (i.e., the labs can be run on-premise if desired, but
are really intended to be run in the cloud). 

Labs include the following:
* Setting up a cloud starter account and connecting to it
* Loading data into an IMDG IMap (cache)
* Querying data in the IMap 

Slides, instructor's guide, etc. are still under development, contact
Mike Yawn (mike@hazelcast.com) if you're planning on presenting this 
material to get the accompanying materials.
